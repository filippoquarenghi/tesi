\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

\thispagestyle{empty}

I want to thank prof. Marco Paganoni and Elisabetta De Bernardi for the opportunity they offered me. I thank particularly Elisabetta for her constant presence and guidance throughout the duration of this work. It has been a pleasure working with her. I also want to thank my colleagues at Orobix for continuously inspiring and supporting me, even outside the office.

Finally, I want to thank my family and, in particular, my parents, that constantly and unconditionally supported me throughout my journey.
